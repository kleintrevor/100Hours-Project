<h2>Manager on Duty 0.1</h2>

Website will optimize the time spent reporting MoD updates between departments.

This will also allow managers/ directors/ GM/ Business unit manager to check up on and have a running tally from each department without waiting on all information to flow through the MoD and out onto the Operations Line.

This will effectively allow an additional 30 minutes of availability on the MoDâ€™s schedule, allowing them to interface and solve larger problems over the course of the day.

- add search function to search through pulsecheck information for display
- change visablility of pulsecheck data entry by department, keeping with each departments required reporting
- add admin control panel
