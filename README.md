# 100Hours Project
Website will optimize the time spent reporting MoD updates between departments.

This will also allow managers/ directors/ GM/ Business unit manager to check up on and have a running tally from each department without waiting on all information to flow through the MoD and out onto the Operations Line.

This allows will effectively a lot an additional 30 minutes of availability on the MoDâ€™s schedule, allowing them to interface and solve larger problems over the course of the day.
