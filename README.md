<h2>Manager on Duty 0.1</h2>

Website will optimize the time spent reporting MoD updates between departments.

This will also allow managers/ directors/ GM/ Business unit manager to check up on and have a running tally from each department without waiting on all information to flow through the MoD and out onto the Operations Line.

This will effectively allow an additional 30 minutes of availability on the MoDâ€™s schedule, allowing them to interface and solve larger problems over the course of the day.


<h2>Things to add in the future:</h2>

- sort output by department for display on grid
- set up database schema for each department
- polish DOM
- role authentication based on department of user
- update with react
